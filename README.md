# <a name="about"></a> About the Project

This project was a personal project that I have been wanting to build since learning D3js and APIs. I found the Data.gov API service, which opened up a whole world of data that I could tap into. Considering the upcoming election, this was top of my list. I had to solve CORS issues with sending API info, plus integrating D3, that directly manipulates DOM, with ReactJS, which renders DOM on state change. This was certainly a big leap for me, integrating what I've learned in a cohesive app.

I have plans to add more financial information, leading up to a big visualization that mixes Congress voting records to with donation records. Watch this repo for updates.
